A curated list of awesome AI agent platforms and tools for building, deploying, and managing AI agents by [Daniel Rosehill](http://danielrosehill.com).

For a detailed analysis of the AI agent platform landscape, see our [(Opinionated) Notes on AI Agent & Assistant Platforms](notes.md).

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous systems powered by large language models (LLMs) that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environment. Unlike simple chatbots, agents can maintain context, use tools, and work toward specific goals.
