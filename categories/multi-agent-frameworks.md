[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-black?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/OpenAgentX/AgentVerse)

A framework for multi-agent simulation and collaboration.

## Role-Playing Agents

Frameworks for agents that take on specific roles, personas, or characters to accomplish tasks.

### [AgentTuning](https://github.com/THUDM/AgentTuning)

[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-black?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/THUDM/AgentTuning)
